To Do:

* The second program is an implementation of shellsort using the best sequence described in your text.  
* The third program will implement bottom up mergesort.  

Use arrays or vectors for your shellsort and mergesort programs.  You are not required to use classes or objects for any of the programs, though, of course, you may.  If you build a linked list class, put your sort inside that class.  You are expected to use reasonable program design – programs that have no functions except main will do no better than a C.  Note that your sorting functions are NOT to be templated (I do not want you just copying code out of the book).


For each program, you are to read a file of integers (longs), sort them, and write them into an output file.  The input files will contain one integer per line, and the output files must be in the same format.  Your program will accept the names of the input and output files as command line parameters.  Your program must be able to handle files of up to at least 1,000,000 longs. Sample input files will be given later in ReggieNet. 

Hints for figuring out whether or not your programs work – check out the sort and diff commands for UNIX.
